REXXFORM - an ISPF Edit Macro (Command) to format and do some basic syntax checking of REXX

REXXFORM is an ISPF edit macro used to format REXX EXECs by indentingDO and SELECT groups and left-justifying lines at a selected column.

  composing them without regard for any particular format or standard coding style.
